HIGH PRIORITY
- crud operations for extensions.json and addons.json databases
- implement remaining operations (delete, list, update)
- reorganize manifest usage

MID PRORITY
- async tasks execute without waiting
- each crate has it's own error module
- multi progress bar
- parallel extension installs
- send multiple extensions in one query in order to avoid multiple requests - avoid spamming mozilla servers
- tokio::task::spawn vec and then run

LOW PRIORITY
- &str instead of String
- access modifiers
- alphabetically order struct fields
- borrows and ownerships
- code documentation
- configuration file
- description languages
- fix proc macros
- install extensions to /tmp
- if install vec is empty, print "no extension found"
- install for multiple browsers
- install for multiple profiles
- log flag, path
- man file
- manually enable/disable extensions
- more browsers and respective data paths
- prompt for reinstall, force install etc.
- references, ownerships, lifetimes
- remove clone, cloned, to_owned, unwrap, as_str, format!
- search params (sort output by rating, score...)
- smallvec, tinyvec
- thunderbird support
- verbose flag
- windows and macos compatibility
