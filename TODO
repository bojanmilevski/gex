MID PRORITY
- async tasks execute without waiting
- each crate has it's own error module
- multi progress bar
- parallel extension installs
- replace for and while loops with tokio_stream::iter
- send multiple extensions in one query in order to avoid multiple requests - avoid spamming mozilla servers
- tokio::task::spawn vec and then run

LOW PRIORITY
- &str instead of String
- alphabetically order struct fields
- borrows and ownerships
- code documentation
- configuration file
- description languages
- fix proc macros
- if error, do not place installed extension in profile dir
- if list empty, print "no extension found"
- install for multiple browsers
- install for multiple profiles
- log flag, path
- man file
- manually enable/disable extensions
- more browsers and respective data paths
- prompt (ext is already installed. reinstall?, are you sure?), options to auto accept/deny
- remove clone, cloned, to_owned, unwrap, as_str, format!
- search params (sort output by rating, score...)
- smallvec, tinyvec
- struct and field access
- thunderbird support
- verbose flag
